# Speed-Graphic-Builder

### Intodution

An Android application called "Speed Graphic Builder" will allow interface to chart different functions. User has just set 
function and he got result in a tick.

### User Requirements

##### - Software Interfaces:
  - Will base on Android SDK
  - Application will use GraphView library

##### - User Interface:
After entering function in the appropriate field the graphics moduling stars. After that graph is displayed
on the coordinate plane. User is able to zoom in/out the graph, see further subsequent behavior of the function 
graph along one of the axes.
As mockups attached some screens of analog application called "Grapher Free", which interface similar to the application 
being developed.
  - Example of three functions's graphics, inputed by the user into the appropriate fields

##### - User Characteristics
This application intended for all users who have smartphones and who necessary in fast graphic builder. So this application does not 
requires any special skills. Product will have volume guide, which help users to sort out with app's organizing principle.

##### - Assumptions and Dependencies
Application does not requires nothing to work properly.

### System Requirements

##### - Functional Requirements

  - Parsing of the entering function by the user (of course, if it entered correctly)
  - Showing the graphic of this function of the coordinate plane
  - The ability to zoom in/out of the coordinate plane with graphic
  - The ability to see further subsequent behavior of the function graph along one of the axes
  - Changing colour of the function's graphic
  - The ability to superimpose the graphich on another one (possibly)
  
##### - Non Functional Requirements
  - Ð¡lear manual for users (analog "Grapher Free" does not characterized by good manual)
  - Adding tips on the interface elements (to help novice users to navigate in the application)
  - Comfortable interface (full set of the interface elements to comfortable working with the application)
  - Safe operation of the application (correct graphic showing)
